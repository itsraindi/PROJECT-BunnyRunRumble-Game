# PROJECT-Bunny-Run-Rumble-Game
Based on HTML5 mini-game
"Rabbit Run Rumble" is an HTML5-based web game, featuring the timeless chase of a wolf and a rabbit. In the game, you play the role of the quick and agile rabbit, constantly on the move to outwit the pursuing wolf. The vibrant game interface is adorned with helpful and hindering elements, including carrots and hedgehogs appearing randomly on your path. Carrots serve as power-ups, boosting your speed, while the hedgehogs act as obstacles, causing you to slow down upon contact. The goal is to achieve maximum distance points( actually no limit), a thrilling challenge that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I drew inspiration from classic animal chase stories, aiming to transform them into an engaging digital experience. The dominant color scheme of the game is green and white, mirroring the lushness of a forest where such chases are commonplace. One of my proudest achievements in creating "Rabbit Run Rumble" was developing a smooth, responsive gameplay experience. In retrospect, I would love to experiment with more diverse power-ups and obstacles for added complexity.  For the website deployment, I used GitHub Pages to build and deploy the website.
The gameplay logic is very easy, just click the left click to jump. Overall, hope you all enjoy it. :)
